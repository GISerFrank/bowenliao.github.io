I'm a first year master student in Geography in Arizona State University(ASU), advised by Wenwen Li. I finished my undergraduate study in Jilin University with a bachelor degree of Geographical Information Science(GIS). My interests now focus on GeoAI, urban informatics, time series forecasting. I plan to pursue a Ph.D after my master study based on the reseach projects I'm going to conduct in the coming two years.
